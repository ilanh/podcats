Here you can write things for this episode.

### Code Blocks in Lists

Indentation matters. Be sure the indent of the code block aligns with the first non-space character after the list item marker (e.g., `1.`). Usually this will mean indenting 3 spaces instead of 4.

1. Do step 1.
2. Now do this:

   ```ruby
   def print_hi(name)
     puts "Hi, #{name}"
   end
   print_hi('Tom')
   #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
   ```
        
3. Now you can do this.

### GitHub Gist Embed

An example of a Gist embed below:

<script defer=true src="https://gist.github.com/sylhare/dad7ed1ef3d13614c77c4ebadf8a11c3.js"></script>

You can use `defer=true` so that the loading of the gist doesn't prevent the loading of the page.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
   <script defer=true 
           src="https://gist.github.com/sylhare/dad7ed1ef3d13614c77c4ebadf8a11c3.js">
   </script>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
